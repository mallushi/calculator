# calculator

In this project I tested my skills on string methods, DOM manipulation, CSS styling. My aim was to create a calculator that could do 4 type of operations: add, subtract, multiply and divide. The user can enter 2 numbers and an operator type equal sign and get the result accordingly. Also the calculator has the ability to clean and delete.
